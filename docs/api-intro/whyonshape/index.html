Onshape?</li></ol></nav><div class=td-content><h1>Why Onshape?</h1><header class=article-meta></header><h2 id=why-onshape>Why Onshape?</h2><p>As long as there have been applications that manage organizational data
into a database, there has been a need to share that data between
different departments and therefore, usually, different systems. In a
typical design/manufacturing organization, there could be at least four
or five mission-critical databases that manage the data for different
departments and for different stages in the product’s lifecycle.</p><p>Initially, these systems provide the capabilities required by their
consumers (i.e., the departments that use these systems). For instance,
the Finance might use QuickBooks, Manufacturing
might use a manufacturing planning and execution system (MES),
Engineering might use a Product Data management System (PDM), and so on for each
group in the organization.</p><p>This often leads to disparate silos of data and knowledge.
The departments in an organization do not work in a vacuum; each is
dependent on information generated by other groups. For
instance, Manufacturing can’t produce accurate assembly instructions
without input from engineering on the designs and the bill of
materials. Finance can’t price the product without understanding its
contents and which parts are manufactured in-house or
purchased.</p><p>Therefore, the need to integrate these systems becomes critical for the
organization to function optimally. Initially, connecting one system to
another can be a straightforward process. This usually involves
some services to get the systems to talk to each other, however it
isn&rsquo;t too painful as long as the requirements are clearly
defined.</p><p>Anyone who has implemented integrations between PLM (Product
Lifecycle Management) systems or ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems will tell
you of the nightmare scenarios they encountered. Often this is the
result of poorly scoped and defined requirements, conflicting
requirements coming from multiple departments, and the many integration
points required between systems. The result is that the organization is
not getting what it wants or needs, the customer is paying for services
that do not provide the promised solution, and usually the project is
long overdue. All this equals an unhappy customer and often the software
vendor’s solutions are blamed for the disaster.</p><p>Over the years, many technologies have appeared (and some of them, just as
quickly disappeared) to enable integration without the need
to write thousands of lines of custom code that needs to be re-written
for every software upgrade. Several technologies provide “codeless” integration between SaaS
products (<a href=wwww.zapier.com>Zapier</a>, for example). These solutions
are particularly good for generic use cases for data exchange between
systems, but can be limited when it comes to custom modifications to the
data being sent that might be required by a specific customer. In
addition, they have the overhead of requiring a subscription to their
service. Sending
corporate IP through another third-party can also cause data security issues.</p><p>Therefore, we can understand that in most organizations integration
between systems is a necessary evil that must be tackled, either with
an out-of-the-box solution or through some custom coding.</p><p>Early on, Onshape understood that as an engineering system, it cannot
exist in a vacuum; it must be able to communicate with other systems.
For this reason, the REST API was developed.</p><p>An API, or <em>application
programming interface</em>, is a set of rules that define how applications
or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is
an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST,
or <em>representational state transfer <em>architectural style. For this
reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs</em>.</em></p><h2 id=onshape-saas>Onshape SaaS</h2><p>Onshape was built from the ground up as a true SaaS-based system; Onshape had no investment in legacy code and was able to develop an application that truly runs as a multi-tenant
SaaS solution from the first line of code. Many companies claim to run
cloud-based solutions, but since they have such a large investment
in their legacy code, that they can’t just discard and start again from
scratch. Instead, they tend to try and port that code to the web.</p><p>More often than not, porting existing code to the web and calling it a
SaaS solution is no more than a marketing ploy; it isn’t a true SaaS
solution if it wasn’t written as one. These are generally known as cloud-hosted solutions. This means that a typical three-tier data management
solution (which could have previously been installed on a set of servers),
has now been modified to be hosted on the web.</p><h3 id=traditional-three-tier-architecture>Traditional three-tier architecture</h3><p>Traditional PLM systems typically use a three-tier architecture, mainly
consisting of an application server, a database server, and a client (either a web client or a thick client installed on the client
hardware).</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage10.png style=width:4.91807in;height:3.27083in alt="The 3-tier architecture | Download Scientific Diagram"></p><p><em>Typical three-tier architecture</em></p><p>To connect to and integrate with this architecture, APIs are usually exposed on
the application or web server. If this
architecture is ported to the web, it cannot make
customizations through the API, since it would modify the behavior of
the program for everyone connected to that application server.</p><h3 id=single--vs-multiple-tenant-architectures>Single- vs multiple-tenant architectures</h3><p>The three-tier architecture is typical of most
PLM solutions on the market today, which is fine
if you want the solution to be installed on company servers and be
accessible to people within the company only.</p><p>When this type of solution is ported to the web, software
vendors typically must create a single-tenant application where an
application server and a database server are provisioned for each new
customer.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage11.png style=width:5.4311in;height:4.35417in alt="Enterprise SaaS Architecture - The Why | Frontegg"></p><p><em>Single-tenant architecture</em></p><p>In this case, the vendor must use expensive
hardware to host more customers, which is not a
sustainable model.</p><p>Modern 21<sup>st</sup> century software solutions use multi-tenant
solutions that can be hosted on services such as Amazon cloud, Azure, etc. There are many benefits to this architecture, including that servers can be provisioned and
decommissioned on the fly to provide ultimate performance whenever
required. Since servers cost money, decommissioning servers when they
are not required is a key benefit to a true SaaS solution.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage12.png style=width:6.5in;height:4.65417in alt="Saas Solutions - Multi-tenant vs multi-instance architectures"></p><p><em>Multi-tenant architecture</em></p><p>Since each application is separate in this architecture, we can enable customizations that can’t be implemented in a single-tenant architecture. For example, we can provide access to the REST
APIs that are required for Onshape integration. In the single-tenant
architecture, if you provide API access to the application server, one
customer will be modifying that application for all customers who are
registered on that tenant.</p><h2 id=the-onshape-difference>The Onshape Difference</h2><p>Onshape does not work like other legacy CAD systems. Onshape was built from scratch for the cloud and as a modern
CAD system, so many of the failings of legacy CAD
systems were excluded.</p><p>There are many differences
and benefits to Onshape, which are well-documented in the Onshape Help
and training materials.</p><p>The information in this section is specific to integrations, since Onshape does not behave like a traditional file-based
systems. When writing an integration for Onshape, it is
critical to understand the nuances in Onshape’s design practices and how
data is organized in Onshape.</p><h3 id=data-drivenfileless>Data-driven/fileless</h3><p>Most traditional PDM/PLM systems integrated with CAD systems
enable this integration on a per-file basis. This means that you have an
object in the PDM/PLM system that corresponds directly to a file in the
CAD system. In this way, the PDM/PLM system can manage access to the
files, build assemblies from the files, view the CAD data, and much more.</p><p>Onshape, however, does not work this way.</p><p>Being data-driven means that Onshape has no files, just data, so an integration into Onshape is going to look
different from any integration to a CAD system that you might have done
previously.</p><p>In traditional CAD, a single file represents a snapshot of what the
design looked like at a specific moment in time. Unless it’s changed, it will remain in that state forever. PDM
systems manage these files, and once a designer decides to make a
revision or a release, the file is locked, and a new file can be created
to represent any further updated versions or releases of the design.
PDM/PLM systems are very good at managing this data in an up-to-date
structure, but it does have the drawbacks. They generate many file
copies of a specific design, and once a file is taken out from the system (for instance, to share with a supplier), it is no longer managed and
tracked.</p><p>Onshape uses data instead of files. The data is always up-to-date and
can be collaborated on in real-time without the need to send file copies
back and forth. This means that Onshape views versions and releases differently
than those traditional systems do. When integrating with Onshape, we must design for data rather than files.</p><p>Files can be generated from
the Onshape data. For example, you can generate a PDF of a
drawing upon release or of a STEP file that can be used by other downstream systems.</p><p>A key benefit of a data-driven system is the ability to retrieve detailed, real-time
analytics. Onshape has comprehensive analytics; including who can view or edit a design, when and exactly what edits are made, which commands were used, and how long was spent modifying the design.</p><h3 id=built-in-pdm>Built in PDM</h3><p>Up until now, CAD was one software program, and PDM/PLM was another
program that had to be integrated with the CAD. In many cases, both
programs could be sold by the same software vendor (even though there
are many PLM systems available that are sold by independent vendors who
have no CAD system). Regardless, a PDM/PLM system always had to be an added solution to the CAD system.</p><p>No matter how deep the integration between a CAD system and a PLM
system, there is always the need to sync data between the two. This is usually a weak point in any solution that is prone to errors.</p><p>Being data-driven, Onshape already has PDM built in as part of the CAD
system. This is unique in the industry: CAD and PDM as part
of the same solution with no additional piece of software required.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage14.png style=width:4.49202in;height:4.1652in alt="A picture containing graphical user interface Description automatically generated"></p><p><em>Onshape’s revision and part number schema definition interface</em></p><p>For instance:</p><ul><li><p>Since the <strong>data is always up-to-date</strong>, the correct state of any design
is always represented in real-time with no delay for syncing between
systems.</p></li><li><p>Unlike file-based systems, <strong>the data is never locked</strong>; it
is always available and always changing.</p></li><li><p>PDM system <strong>data management aspects are fully integrated</strong> into every aspect of
the CAD system.</p></li><li><p>True <strong>real-time collaboration/co-design</strong> on both design and data is
enabled.</p></li></ul><p>So, what does this mean when it comes to integrating Onshape with
another PLM system? First and foremost, we must understand that there
are many things that a PLM system does that Onshape’s PDM capabilities
can’t do. Integrating Onshape to a PLM system should augment the
powerful capabilities already available inside Onshape, not
necessarily replace them. Similarly, Onshape does not replace PLM-native capabilities. Instead, depending on the business case, we can use the best-in-class capabilities of each system to augment the
other.</p><p>The Onshape release process is an example of the augmentation of each system&rsquo;s capabilities. Onshape has a specific way of managing the release of data that is
different from traditional PDM systems. This capability is inherently
suited to a data-driven approach and provides a lot of value to the
update of design data in Onshape. At the same time, PLM systems provide
enterprise release processes that may include many people and different
departments that extend beyond the engineering domain. Such PLM
processes can be highly customized and suited to the organizations
established business processes.</p><p>In this scenario, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to avoid the enterprise release
processes in the PLM system. However, also omitting Onshape’s release
capabilities could put data between Onshape and the PLM system out of
sync and prevent Onshape from updating data (e.g., watermarks and
title blocks on drawings, icons related the visualizing the state of
data, etc.).</p><p>In this case, we want to use the best-in-class features of each software
solution without compromising the capability provided by each solution.
If we plan our integration correctly, this can be achieved by initiating
the release of the data in Onshape, transferring the release data to the
PLM system where the release process will be triggered, and finally
automating the release in Onshape once the process has been completed in
the PLM system.</p><h3 id=multi-part-part-studios>Multi-part Part Studios</h3><p>In traditional CAD systems, one file typically equals
one part. While design-in-context is available in most CAD systems, and
multiple solid bodies can be created, each part is self-contained in a separate file. For PLM systems, this
makes it easy to associate an object in the PDM/PLM database with a
specific CAD file. <em>This is not the case in Onshape.</em></p><p>In Onshape, parts are designed in what’s called a <em>Part Studio.</em> Within
a Part Studio, the designer is free to create as many parts as they want.
The general rule is that the parts should be related to each other in a
system, thereby making it easier to design one part from another, however
there is a lot of flexibility in how the designer wishes to work.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage15.png style=width:4.45764in;height:4.12141in alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"></p><p><em>An example of a multi-part Part Studio in Onshape</em></p><p>The structure of the Onshape document is discussed in detail in the <a href=/docs/api-intro/architecture>Onshape Architecture</a> page. The Part Studio is included in an Onshape document.</p><p>We can already begin to understand that the traditional CAD/PDM paradigm
of &ldquo;one file per object&rdquo; will not work with Onshape; the designer would be forced by the
PDM/PLM system to only create one part per Part Studio. This would
therefore limit the designer’s freedom for creativity in Onshape and
seriously reduce the powerful functionality available for the designer
to use.</p><p>Therefore, we need to re-think how we integrate with Onshape versus how we
integrate with traditional CAD systems. Fortunately, Onshape’s REST API
supports the multi-part Part Studio scenario. Instead of associating a
file with an object in the PDM/PLM database, we now use the REST API to
associate a Part with its corresponding object.</p><h3 id=versions-and-releases>Versions and releases</h3><p>Traditional PDM/PLM systems provide design release support by locking a
CAD file for access. The access controls are defined in the database and
the definition of a part/assembly/drawing as released is controlled by
the database. When a new revision of the part is required, a file copy
is made, and the database provides access to the new copy. Generally,
the old copy representing the previous release persists in the file
store and can be referenced by the database. <em>This is not how Onshape works.</em></p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage16.png style=width:2.66865in;height:3.09375in>Since there are no files in
Onshape (just data) no file locking or copy mechanisms are
available. Instead, Onshape looks at the data as a continuous timeline
that is always moving forward and always changing as the design evolves.
The data is never locked; it is always available.</p><p>In place of file copies that represent versions and releases of the
design, Onshape provides the ability to create <em>versions</em> as bookmarks
in the timeline. When creating a version, Onshape places a bookmark in
the timeline that represents the state of the design at that specific
moment in time. Releases work in a similar way, but they are defined
as official, company-approved processes and have special meaning.</p><p>In addition to creating versions and releases, Onshape can create <em>branches</em>, which can be defined as alternative timelines. A
designer might want to experiment with alternate design ideas without
modifying the existing design that others are working on. By
creating a branch from any point in the timeline, the designer is
free to experiment with alternate ideas. If the ideas work, they can be
merged into the current timeline at any point.</p><p>From an integration perspective, we need to take into
consideration how Onshape works with versions and releases. Since a release represents a company-approved design, Onshape provides processes for the approval of
a release and the change of state of a design. Onshape also provides
APIs and triggers (events) that enable integration points throughout the
release process. It is through the triggers and the APIs that
integration of any third-party system that wishes to manage the release
process is enabled.</p><h3 id=workflows>Workflows</h3><p>Release and obsoletion workflows are included with Onshape and can be customized to meet company standards.</p><p>For details on how to implement and customize Onshape’s workflows,
please review these online help topics:</p><ul><li><a href=https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/relmgmt_custom.htm>How to design release management processes</a></li><li><a href=https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/custom_workflow.htm>How to create a customized release workflow</a></li></ul><p>Most PDM/PLM systems can model a company’s
business processes in a workflow. These can be highly automated
processes that move data and file references through a process of
reviews and approvals. Onshape also has this capability, which is
currently used for release and obsoletion processes.</p><p>There are no files or file references in Onshape that are moved
through the process. Onshape only has data. Therefore, it is the data
that is referenced at each stage of the process. Traditional PDM systems
might make file copies and lock files as they move through a release
process. If the process is rejected at any stage, those
files must be discarded, the previous version of the files unlocked and
all states updated. In short, it system must rewind back to the state of the files and
the data when the workflow was initiated. This is a lot of complex
actions that must occur when a process is rejected for any reason. <em>Onshape doesn’t work this way.</em></p><p>A release process can be started on data (such as assemblies, parts,
drawings, etc.). For example, if the state of a referenced part is updated to
“Pending,” and the process is rejected at any stage, there
is no rewinding of files and data; the data just reverts to the
original “In Progress” state, and the workflow is discarded. Since the
workflow didn’t complete, nothing related to the data has actually
changed. When you are used to traditional PDM systems, this feels like
an anti-climax, and we often receive the question, “But where’s my
process? Where’s the data that was attached to the process?”. Well, the
answer is: nothing changed. Until the process is completed, nothing
actually changes, so the data is in the same state it was prior to the
initialization of the release process.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage17.png style=width:3.39863in;height:2.61034in alt="A picture containing chart Description automatically generated"></p><p><em>A custom release process in Onshape</em></p></div></main></div></div><footer class="td-footer row d-print-none"><div class=container-fluid><div class="row mx-md-2"><div class="td-footer__left col-6 col-sm-4 order-sm-1"></div><div class="td-footer__right col-6 col-sm-4 order-sm-3"></div><div class="td-footer__center col-12 col-sm-4 py-2 order-sm-2"></div></div></div></footer></div><script src=/js/main.min.69e2c1ae9320465ab10236d9ef752c6a4442c54b48b883b17c497b7c7d96a796.js integrity="sha256-aeLBrpMgRlqxAjbZ73UsakRCxUtIuIOxfEl7fH2Wp5Y=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=/js/click-to-copy.min.73478a7d4807698aed7e355eb23f9890ca18fea3158604c8471746d046702bad.js integrity="sha256-c0eKfUgHaYrtfjVesj+YkMoY/qMVhgTIRxdG0EZwK60=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/tabpane-persist.js></script></body></html>
