Prerequisites All Onshape API calls must be properly authenticated. See the API Keys page for instructions and the Quick Start for an example. All applications submitted to the Onshape App Store must authenticate with OAuth2. For Standard accounts, replace {baseUrl} with cad in all endpoints. For Enterprise accounts, replace it with your company domain.

Call the createPartStudio endpoint. Specify a name for the new tab in the request body; in this example, we’ll call it newPartStudio1. curl -X 'POST' \ 'https://cad.onshape.com/api/v9/partstudios/d/{did}/w/{wid}' \ -H 'Accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8; qs=0.09' \ -H 'Authorization: Basic CREDENTIALS' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8; qs=0.09' \ -d '{ &#34;name&#34;: &#34;newPartStudio1&#34; }' Return to your document and observe that the new assembly tab has been added. Get the list of features in a Part Studio One of the best ways to familiarize yourself with the Onshape Feature APIs is to view the API details for existing features in a Part Studio. In this example, we’ll add three features to a Part Studio, and then call the getPartStudioFeatures API on the Part Studio. We’ll then be able to view the structure of the way features are represented in the API."><link rel=preload href=/scss/main.min.7622946b88aadfa24dcf933afaf03525457e05cdace62229bf02030f0a66d236.css
