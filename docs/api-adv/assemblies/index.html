📘 Notes
This page provides sample code as curls. See the curl documentation for more information. All Onshape API calls must be properly authenticated by replacing the CREDENTIALS variable in the curls below. See the API Keys page for instructions and the Quick Start for an example. All applications submitted to the Onshape App Store must authenticate with OAuth2. This documentation refers to Onshape IDs in the following format: {did}, {wid}, {eid}, {pid}, {otherId}. These represent document, workspace, element, part, and other IDs (respectively) that are needed make the API calls. We sometimes abbreviate these variables as DWVEM Please see API Guide: API Intro for information on what these IDs mean and how to obtain them from your documents. Never include the curly braces ({}) in your API calls. For Enterprise accounts, replace cad in all Onshape URLs with your company domain. https://cad.onshape.com > https://companyName .onshape.com For additional instruction and video content, visit the Learning Center’s Intro to the Onshape API course.
