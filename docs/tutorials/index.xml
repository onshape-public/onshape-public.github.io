that I create in Onshape with my ERP or PLM system?”. There could be
many reasons why you would want to sync data between two different
systems. Primarily Onshape is a system that creates new data. This data
is created by designers as they perform their daily tasks. While the
designer works primarily in Onshape, the actual data that they create
does not exist in a vacuum, it is used by other departments, other
processes within the organization. These departments and processes
probably do not have access to Onshape or the required knowledge of how
to use Onshape. In addition, quite often, the data generated by Onshape
will be augmented with additional data as the product lifecycle process
progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sync Releases and Revisions</title><link>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/releases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/releases/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This tutorials builds off the &lt;a href="https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/sync"&gt;Sync Data and Metadata&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. Please complete that one before starting on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we’ll be looking at the ability for Onshape to sync its
release data with an external system and for that system to send
information back to Onshape with regards to released data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specific business case will look at what happens when you wish for
a PLM system to control the release of data instead of Onshape having
that control – this is in fact a common use case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Generate Derivative Files</title><link>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/derivative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/derivative/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This tutorials builds off the &lt;a href="https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/releases"&gt;Sync Releases and Revisions&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. Please complete that one before starting on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear by now that Onshape doesn’t use files to store its data,
instead it is a data driven solution that is always up to date. Files
are a snapshot in time that provide a view of the design at a specific
point in time - such as at a release or version. A new file is required
for each “snapshot” and managing these files can get quite cumbersome.
However, there are situations that require that files be generated from
the Onshape data.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Create an Extension</title><link>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/createextension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/tutorials/createextension/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this example, you will create a custom web page (as shown in the image below) that is displayed in the
right-hand fly-out panel. This interface displays metadata pulled from
a third-party system when a part in Onshape is selected. This interface can also update metadata in Onshape through the &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to fetch a glTF representation of an Onshape model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create an app that runs as a tab inside an Onshape document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth2 authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of document context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application is built using Express and is deployed on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/onshape-public/app-gltf-viewer"&gt;gltf-viewer-app README&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on running this sample app.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
